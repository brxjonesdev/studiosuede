## Project Overview
StudioSuede is a learning platform for people to learn the basics of synthesis, sound design and music production.

## Motivation
I want to build this project because my hobby is music! I also know very little about anything in the course and I really want to know how synths work.
I won't be able to spend to much time with it until I can get a full time role in development. 

## What I Learned
